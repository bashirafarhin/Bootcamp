manage project using ssh KEY

1. Generate a fresh SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "farhinbashira@gmail.com"
it will ask the file path where it will store the public and private key and then it will
ask for passphrase key

2. Add the key to the SSH agent( to add identity )
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

3. ssh-add -l( to verify if key is added )

4. Copy your new public key and add your new key to GitHub ssh key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub( to get public key )

5. ssh -T git@github.com( testing new setup )
if everything is good then it will show authenticated

6. Check SSH agent is running
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

7. ssh -T git@github.com( to test github connection )

8. Clone a repository via SSH and make changes and then push it it will not ask you to
enter username and password
