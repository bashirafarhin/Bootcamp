ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 10

ps aux → lists all running processes with details.
--sort=-%mem → sorts them in descending order by memory usage (highest first).
head -n 10 → show only top 10

note the PID of the process, pass it in below line
sudo kill PID

sudo adduser devops
It will ask you to set a password and some optional info (you can just press Enter to skip).
This creates a home directory /home/devops.

sudo usermod -aG sudo devops
This adds the user devops to the sudo group, which grants administrative rights.

To confirm:
groups devops
You should see sudo listed among the groups.

Switch to that user (optional check)
su - devops
